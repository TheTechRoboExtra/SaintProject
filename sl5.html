    <h1>Saint Anthony of Padua</h1>

    <details><summary>Return to Italy</summary><p>After St. Francis' death, in 1226, Saint Anthony returned to Italy. This led to yet another miracle. He and his companion were very tired. They entered the house of a poor woman. She gave them bread and wine, but she forgot to turn off the wine barrel's tap, and Saint Anthony's companion broke his glass! Saint Anthony remained calm, however, and prayed. Suddenly, the barrel became full again and the glass sprung back together!</p></details>
    <details><summary>Final sermons</summary><p>A little while after he got back to Italy, he was elected Minister Provincial of Emilia. But because this did not give him enough time to preach, he resigned in 1230, and went to the Covent of Padua (which he had founded, too!). The last time he preached a Lent was in 1231, with an audience of over 30,000. His last sermons spoke of hatred, and they were very successful. Peace became much more common, and prisoners were freed. After Saint Anthony died, some even said that he came to them in their sleep, telling them to go to confession.</p></details>
    <details><Summary>The hits keep on coming</Summary><p>In Padua there was also yet another miracle - the hits keep on coming! Someone had, being very angry, kicked his own mother. Having confessed this to Saint Anthony, he said "The foot of him who kicks his mother deserves to be cut off." The man ran back to his home and cut his foot off. Once Saint Anthony knew, he miraculously put the foot back on.</p></details>
    <details><summary>Death</summary><p>At the end of the Lent of 1231, he went to Camposanpiero. Unfortunately, he soon became severely ill. He died being 36 years old, on June 13, 1231.</p></details>
