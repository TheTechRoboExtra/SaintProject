    <details><summary>1210 to 1220</summary>
        <p>Saint Anthony grew up learning in the Cathedral School. When he was 15 (1210), he joined the Canons and Canonesses Regular, which was just outside the walls of Padua. Having been distracted quite a bit with visits from his family, in 1212 he asked to be transferred to the Convent of Santa Croce in Cóimbra. He stayed there for 8 years. Saint Anthony had an impressive memory, and an excellent understanding, so he had a lot of theological knowledge.</p></details>
    <details><summary>Joining Friars Minor</summary>
        <p>In 1220, after seeing the bodies of the first Franciscan martyrs (a martyr is someone who died because they refused to promote/denounce, depending on the situation, a religious belief) and he wanted to be one too. He decided to become a Friar Minor, preaching and suffering for Christ. He then left the Convent that he'd been at for 8 years to join the Order of Friars Minor. This is also when he changed his name to Anthony.</p></details>
    <details><summary>In Sicily</summary><p>Soon after this, he started toward Morocco, but he got sick for the entire winter. He had to sail to Portugal in the spring of 1221. But his ship was driven onto the coast of Sicily. He stayed there for a little bit so he could get better. He had heard that there was going to be an event, and he made it just in time. After the chapter was over, nobody noticed him. His first biographer write "He said not a word of his studies, nor of the services he had performed; his only desire was to follow Jesus Christ and Him crucified."</p></details>
    <details><summary>Preaching in Montepaolo</summary><p>Soon after Saint Anthony got sent to Montepaolo, a few people got together for ordination. However, it appeared that nobody was chosen to preach! Both parties had thought that the other would preach. Nobody volunteered, saying they weren't ready. Because of this, they appointed Saint Anthony. They thought that he would only be able to read the Missal and Breviary, but he surprised them by explaining an understanding of Scripture so well that it just blew everybody's mind. This is when his time as a public preacher started.</p></details>
