    <h1>Saint Anthony of Padua</h1>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="GoodCSS.css">
    <p>Saint Anthony grew up learning in the Cathedral School. When he was 15 (1210), he joined the Canons and Canonesses Regular, which was just outside the walls of Padua. Having been distracted quite a bit with visits from his family, in 1212 he asked to be transferred to the Convent of Santa Croce in Cóimbra. He stayed there for 8 years. Saint Anthony had an impressive memory, and an excellent understanding, so he had a lot of theological knowledge.</p>
    <p>In 1220, after seeing the bodies of the first Franciscan martyrs (a martyr is someone who died because they refused to promote/denounce, depending on the situation, a religious belief) and he wanted to be one too. He decided to become a Friar Minor, preaching and suffering for Christ. He then left the Convent that he'd been at for 8 years to join the Order of Friars Minor. This is also when he changed his name to Anthony.</p>
