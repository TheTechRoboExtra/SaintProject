    <h1>Saint Anthony of Padua</h1>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="GoodCSS.css">
<!--    <p>Saint Anthony of Padua was born in 1195, and died in 1231. He was then canonized in 1232, making him the one of the fastest canonized saint. He was 35 years old when he died.</p>
    <p>Saint Anthony was born in Lisbon, Portugal as "Fernando Martins de Bulhões". How did he get his name? Well, he joined a small hermitage in Olivais, changing his name to "Anthony" (inspired by the local chapel, which was named after Anthony the Great). Also, in 1226, he went to Padua, Italy, which is where he spent his remaining years, which is why he is Saint Anthony <b>of Padua</b>. </p>
    <p>Writers of the 15th century maintained that Anthony was born to Martin Bouillon and Theresa Tavejra, but his genealogy is a mystery. All the things we know for sure about his family was that they were powerful, God-fearing people.</p>-->
