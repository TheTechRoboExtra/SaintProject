    <h1>Saint Anthony of Padua</h1>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="GoodCSS.css">
    <details><summary>Saint Anthony's mission</summary>He was probably canonized because of the many miracles he performed, and that his life was devoted to God. He even gave up visits from his family so that he could focus on his studies about God. Someone who was around when he was said: <i>"Anthony would preach, teach and confess all day long, until sunset. Often, he would never eat all day long."</i> Both of those made him definitely merit sainthood. </p></details>
    <details><summary>Canonized by who??</summary><p>Saint Anthony was canonized by Pope Gregory IX on 30 May 1232, at Spoleto, Italy. It was less than one year after his death, which shows a lot! Plus, in 1946 he was proclaimed Doctor of the Church by Pope Pius XII, due to how good his sermons were.</p></details>
    <details><Summary>Virtues?</summary><p>Saint Anthony practiced many virtues. He understood <a href="https://www.santantonio.org/en/content/his-personality">the love for God as the supreme good and to love people for the sake of God</a>. He also lived the basic values of poverty, obedience, and humility, considering the latter as the root of all other virtues. He seems to have lived like that for at least most of his life.</p></details>
    <details><summary>Feast Day</summary><p>Saint Anthony's feast day is the 13th of June. I will try to remember to practice it, and I hope you do too!</p></details>
    <details><summary>Patronage</summary>Saint Anthony is a patron saint of a lot of things! The highlights are Lisbon, lost items/people/souls (more on that later), amputees (remember that miracle from earlier?), animals, elderly people, mail, poor/oppressed people (remember that miracle about the poor woman?), pregnant women, Portugal, shipwrecks (remember? his ship wrecked on Sicily?), starvation, infertility, and a lot more. 
        <br>If you're wondering about the lost items, it's probably because of yet another miracle. This one is where someone steals Saint Anthony's psalm book. Anthony prays, and the thief decides to give the book back.</details></p>
    <p><details><summary>Items associated with Saint Anthony</summary>One item associated with Anthony is the tongue. This is due to a legend about him, in which 30 years after he died his body withered away, except for the tongue which still looked like it was alive. This was most likely a sign of his preaching gift. There is also a prayer dedicated to Saint Anthony, that goes something like <a href="https://www.catholicmom.com/articles/st.-anthony-st.-anthony-please-come-around">Saint Anthony, Saint Anthony, please come around. Something is lost and must be found."</a></details></p>
    <p><details><summary>If Saint Anthony were in the world today</summary>If Saint Anthony was in the world right now, I think he'd be really sad at how much poverty and how little virtues in the world there are, and how we're trashing the Earth. I think that he'd continue his sermons, but that not many people would listen because everybody would be glued to their phones. It's my sad opinion.</details></p>
    <p>More coming soon!</p>
