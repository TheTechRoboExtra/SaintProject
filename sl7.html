    <h1>Saint Anthony of Padua</h1>
    <b>Thanks for checking this out!</b>
    I find Saint Anthony of Padua's life interesting after this. The main reason I started researching whether he would be a good pick, is because he shares my name! Once I started researching him however, he was a great fit - I am very disorganised, and he's the patron saint of lost things :p<br>
    Remember - June 13th is his day of celebration! No, I didn't know either.<br>
